I'm a backend-focused Java developer with hands-on experience building modern web applications using Spring Boot, Spring Core, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring MVC, and JDBC. I specialize in creating scalable, secure, and maintainable applications using the Spring ecosystem.

I'm currently exploring Kafka for event-driven microservices and Redis for caching to boost performance and scalability.

On the frontend, I work with ReactJS and TailwindCSS, designing responsive and dynamic interfaces that integrate seamlessly with RESTful APIs.

I'm also expanding into Cloud Computing and DevOps, learning AWS services like EC2 for server deployment and S3 for static site hosting. My next milestone is to deploy full-stack, cloud-native applications with automated CI/CD pipelines.

I'm always open to collaboration, mentorship, and new challenges as I continue to grow into a Full-Stack Cloud Developer.
