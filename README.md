I’m a backend-focused Java developer with hands-on experience building modern web applications using Spring Boot, Spring Core, Spring Data JPA, Spring MVC, and JDBC. My journey began with Servlets and JSP, which gave me a solid grasp of backend fundamentals, but I’ve since transitioned to leveraging Spring Boot to create scalable, secure, and maintainable applications.

On the frontend, I work with ReactJS and TailwindCSS, designing responsive and dynamic interfaces that integrate seamlessly with RESTful backends.

I’m currently expanding into Cloud Computing and DevOps, learning AWS services such as EC2 for server deployment and S3 for static site hosting. My next milestone is to deploy full-stack cloud-native applications with automated CI/CD pipelines.

I’m always open to collaboration, mentorship, and new challenges as I continue to grow into a Full-Stack Cloud Developer.
